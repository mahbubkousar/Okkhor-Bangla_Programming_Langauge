# Okkhor - Bengali Programming Language

## Overview

Okkhor is an imperative, general-purpose programming language designed to make coding more accessible for Bengali-speaking students, particularly in rural Bangladesh. By using Bengali syntax, it eliminates language barriers and promotes STEM education.

## Features

- Fully Bengali-based syntax with keywords, operators, and literals.
- Custom lexer and parser for tokenization and syntax analysis.
- Intermediate Representation (IR) and a Virtual Machine (VM) for executing programs.
- Support for control flow structures, including conditional statements and loops.
- Basic error handling in the lexer and parser for debugging.

## Technical Details

1. **Lexer Implementation**

   - Tokenizes Bengali keywords, operators, and identifiers.
   - Uses Unicode regex to recognize Bengali characters.
   - Converts Bengali numerals into standard numeric values.

2. **Parser Implementation**

   - Uses recursive descent parsing to construct an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
   - Supports variable declarations, expressions, and function definitions.

3. **Intermediate Representation (IR) Generator**

   - Converts the AST into a structured bytecode format for execution.

4. **Virtual Machine (VM) Execution**
   - Implements a stack-based execution engine for running bytecode.
   - Supports fundamental operations such as arithmetic, assignment, and control flow.

## Challenges

- The parser is incomplete and struggles with nested structures and error handling.
- The semantic analysis phase is not yet implemented, affecting type validation.
- The IR and VM need further integration with the compiler for full functionality.

## Future Work

- Improve the parser with enhanced lookahead support for better syntax analysis.
- Implement a semantic analyzer to ensure proper type checking and error detection.
- Optimize the virtual machine for efficient execution of compiled programs.

## Installation & Usage

To use Okkhor, clone the repository and run the compiler using Python. The generated bytecode can then be executed with the virtual machine.
